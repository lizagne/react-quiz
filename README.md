# react-quiz
## A repo for the quiz challenges for end of week 9 of my Coding Fellowship at DevelopMe_.

React quiz questions are:

# React

Create a new React app called quiz for the following challenges. Add the Bootstrap CSS file and try to use Bootstrap styling where appropriate.
Questions

    Create a component <Multiplier x={ 5 } y={ 7 } /> that takes two props, x and y, and outputs their product (i.e. x × y) in a <p>.

    Create a component <EvenClicks> that displays "Even" if it's been clicked an even number of times and "Odd" if it's been clicked an odd number of times.

    Create a component <CountBy step={ 5 }> that takes a step prop. It should display a number (starting at 0) inside a <p>. Every time it is clicked the number should go up by step.

    Create a component <HideMe>Blah blah blah</HideMe> that uses children to accept some content. When the component is clicked the content should be hidden.

    Create a component <MinimumLength length={ 30 }> that contains an <input>. The user should see a warning, "Too short!", unless they have entered at least length characters.

## ReactRouter

    Visiting /even-clicks shows <EvenClicks>

    Visiting /hide-me shows <HideMe>

    Visiting /count-by/5 shows <CountBy> with the step value set to 5 (it should work for any value in the URL)

    Visiting /minimum/20 shows <MinimumLength> with the minimum length set to 20 (it should work for any value in the URL)

    Visiting /multiplier/20/30 uses <Multiplier> and displays the result of 20×30 (it should work for any values in the URL)

## Tricksy

    Create a component <Posts> that consists of a list of items that have a title and some text. Underneath the list of items should be a <Form> component that has a "Title" and "Text" input and a "Submit" button. You should only be able to submit the form if all the inputs have something typed in them. When the form is submitted it should add a new item to the list of posts. The inputs should be controlled by the <Form> component and only pass their values up to <Posts> when the <form>'s onSubmit event handler is fired.
